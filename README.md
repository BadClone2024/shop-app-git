Welcome to my Shop App angular application.
Usage:
you have two user options, one for a simple one and one for an administrator.
in order to create an administrator user you need to have the next password:
"Admin2050". 
Simple user:
Simple buyer experience with some product list and a cart that he can add poducts there.
Admin:
Can manage the products inside the application (like create, delete and edit) and see which users are currently online and which are not.
